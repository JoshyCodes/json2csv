# json2csv
convert json file to csv file

Single HTML page with embedded Javascript

designed by employment 'homework' test to take a locally saved json file and upon button click will parse json data, filter and format information then generate a csv file that downloads with header information.

While formating and filtering data, functions are also in place to sanitize strings and remove multiple entries of related information. 

Uses ES6+ Javascript with Async/Await function and due to large size, uses a blob object during generation.
